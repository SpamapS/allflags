We need a Python program that generates all the possible flags with 3 colored
stripes, see attachment.  The colors can be: White, Black, Green, Red, Blue,
Green and Orange.

Question 1: Please generate alle the possible flags. One color van not be the
same in two stripes next to each other. So green, white, green is possible.

Question 2: Please generate alle the possible flags. One color can only be used
onces in a flag. So green, white, green is not good, but So green, white, blue
is possible.

Make a Python-program (for mathematic education) that makes this visable. We
leave it to your creativity if it is possible to show the flags very small on
the screen.

It would be very nice if you can help us!

Thanks in advance, Durk Jan de Bruin

PS: Not all the flags exist in real countries. That is no problem
